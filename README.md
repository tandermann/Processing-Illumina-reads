# NGS
This repository is a compilation of scripts and documentations for the processing and analysis of NGS sequence capture data (Illumina).
The material covers:  
- processing and analysis of UCE (Ultraconserved Elements) datasets  
- assembly and annotation of mitochondrial genomes  
- general pipelines for processing of illumina reads with CLC and samtools, including:  
  - mapping against a reference sequence (creating bam-files)
  - phasing the reads, finding alleles
  - creating consensus sequences with samtools mpileup
  - formatting the results for phylogenetic analyses
