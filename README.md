# NGS
This repository is a compilation of scripts and documentations for the processing and analysis of NGS sequence capture data (Illumina).
The material covers:  
- general pipelines for processing of illumina reads with CLC and samtools, including:  
- mapping against a reference sequence (creating bam-files)
- phasing the reads, finding alleles
- creating consensus sequences with samtools mpileup
- formatting the results for phylogenetic analyses
